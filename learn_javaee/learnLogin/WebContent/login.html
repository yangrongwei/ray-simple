<form method="get|post">

The form-data can be sent as URL variables (with method="get") or as HTTP post transaction (with method="post").

Notes on GET:

Appends form-data into the URL in name/value pairs
o The length of a URL is limited (about 3000 characters)
o Never use GET to send sensitive data! (will be visible in the URL)
o Useful for form submissions where a user want to bookmark the result
o GET is better for non-secure data, like query strings in Google
o Notes on POST:

Appends form-data inside the body of the HTTP request (data is not shown is in URL)
o Has no size limitations
o Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked
